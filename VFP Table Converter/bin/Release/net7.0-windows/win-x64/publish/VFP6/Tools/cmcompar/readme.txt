Do you ever wonted to compare two tables for structure or index differences? Not so easy, but you can - DISPLAY STRUCTURE and so on.
For two table - OK. But do you ever wonted to compare two FOLDERS table by table for structure or index differences? Generally this is difficult, if each folder has 20 or 100 tables.

Now you can - with the help of this utility. All the procedure takes about few seconds.

I wrote this utility first in FoxPro 2.6. I used it with success about 5 years. Recently I rewrite it in FoxPro 6.
