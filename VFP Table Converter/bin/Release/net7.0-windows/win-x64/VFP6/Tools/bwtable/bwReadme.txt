If you want to control what dbf file list allow user to 'Browse',
you can check the .undercontrol to .T. and modify the bwTable.Load().
You need to fill in the .fileary[?,1] on table choice.

3) Function on bwTable:
-----------------------
Choose 'table', then 'field', then 'mark', then 'condition' and click
'Search'. (Direction from left to right on search!)
You can press 'Search' for continue Search!
<Special Search>
Similar to above action but use Right-Click on Search!
So, only fulfill the condition will show but the date is read only!
<Set Order>
When change the fieldname and it is an index, the grid will auto change
to it right order!
