   SET Commands in CONFIG.FP     
聃컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

If you find that you frequently adjust various SET options 
in a certain manner, you may want to automatically designate 
the default SET values at startup.

The CONFIG.FP file can contain startup defaults for nearly 
all the SET commands, as well as some special CONFIG.FP 
statements.  For additional information about the following 
SET commands, refer to the online help.

    Special CONFIG.FP Items      
聃컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴 

While most items that can be set or changed through the CONFIG.FP 
file are options that can also be controlled with SET commands 
(see the previous section for full details), some CONFIG.FP items 
can be specified only through the CONFIG.FP file.

The following table contains the special CONFIG.FP settings as 
well as the system memory variables.  Items marked with asterisk
( * ) have a footnote following the chart.

--------------------
* FOOTNOTES

CODEPAGE
    [VFP] from help topic CPCURRENT()
    
	  * The code page number specified in the 
	    CODEPAGE configuration item. For example, 
	    CPCURRENT() returns 852 if the following 
	    line is included in your configuration file:

	    CODEPAGE = 852

	  * The current operating system code page 
	    if you have included the following line 
	    in your configuration file:

	    CODEPAGE = AUTO

 
COMMAND
	Executes a valid FoxPro command after all other 
	configuration settings are established.  For 
	instance, if you'd like FoxPro to clear the 
	screen every time it starts, you could use the 
	statement:

		COMMAND = CLEAR 

	Or, if you'd like FoxPro to start a certain 
	program automatically every time, you could use:

		COMMAND = DO <program>

	If you include a DO command like the previous 
	one, you can bypass the named startup program 
	by including the name of a different program 
	when you initially start FoxPro:

		FOXPRO <program>

DOSMEM
    [VFP] DOSMEM special item is no longer needed.
    
	This parameter applies only to the Extended 
	version of FoxPro.  When DOSMEM is on, FoxPro(X) 
	will access and utilize all MS-DOS memory along 
	with any extended memory.  The default is OFF; 
	when DOSMEM is off, FoxPro(X) uses 60 K of MS-DOS 
	memory and the rest is available for execution 
	of the RUN command.  If you want to reserve part 
	of MS-DOS memory, you can use a numeric argument 
	<expN>, where <expN> is the amount of memory in 
	kilobytes to reserve.  

EDITWORK
    [VFP] default is Windows temporary file directory.
    
	  Note: SYS(2023) Returns the path on which
		Visual FoxPro stores its temporary 
		files. 
    
	Specifies where the text editor should place its 
	work files.  In some circumstances, the work file 
	can become as large as the original file; for that 
	reason, this option should only be specified if 
	the alternate location has plenty of free space.

EMS
    [VFP] EMS special item is no longer needed

	Determines whether or not FoxPro will take advantage 
	of expanded memory (EMS) and can limit the amount of 
	EMS that FoxPro uses.  This option is not recognized 
	in the Extended version of FoxPro.

	Generally, FoxPro can coexist with other programs 
	that use expanded memory.  However, if you want 
	specifically to reserve all or part of expanded 
	memory for use by other programs, you have several 
	options:

		EMS = OFF
		EMS = <expN>

	When you use the optional numeric argument, you 
	limit the amount of EMS that FoxPro takes 
	advantage of.  The value is expressed in kilobytes, 
	and it should range from 0 (zero) to the total 
	amount of EMS installed in your computer.  The 
	value should be some multiple of 16, although 
	FoxPro reduces nonincremental values to the 
	nearest 16 K boundary.

	If you have LOAD and CALL routines that use 
	expanded memory, you should be aware that FoxPro 
	always places its own memory back into the expanded 
	memory page frame after a CALL.  If your routines 
	are not prepared for this, you may want to set 
	EMS OFF to prevent it.  The default setting for 
	EMS is ON.

EMS64
    [VFP] EMS64 special item is no longer needed

	On machines with expanded memory that's 
	compatible with LIM 4.0 (or higher), FoxPro 
	automatically uses the first 64 K of expanded 
	memory as "general purpose" memory.  However, 
	certain older EMS emulators cause problems for 
	FoxPro.  If you have an older EMS emulator that 
	causes FoxPro to behave strangely, you can 
	specify that FoxPro not use the first 64 K of 
	expanded memory as general purpose memory with:

		EMS64 = OFF

	Or, you can ignore all expanded memory except 
	for the first 64 K of "general purpose" memory 
	with:

		EMS = 64 

	This option is ignored in FoxPro (X).

F11F12
	Prevents FoxPro from attempting to use the 
	F11 and F12 keys.You may need to use this 
	option if your computer does not have F11 
	and F12 keys and no cursor appears in the 
	Command window when you start FoxPro.  This 
	happens on computers without F11 and F12 
	keys that have certain older versions of 
	the BIOS which erroneously return "yes" 
	when FoxPro tests for the presence of these 
	keys.

_GEN variables  
	You can specify other program names as 
	values for these system variables, 
	using the format:
	
	 <_GEN variable name> = <program name>

INDEX
	Specifies the extension for FoxPro index 
	files.  The default extension is .IDX.

LABEL
	Specifies the extension for FoxPro label 
	definition files.  The default extension 
	is .LBX.

MVCOUNT
    [VFP] maximum 65,000, default 1024.

	Sets the maximum number of memory variables 
	that FoxPro can maintain.  This value may 
	range from 128 to 3,600 in FoxPro standard, 
	or to 65,000 in FoxPro (X); the default is 256.

OUTSHOW
	Disables the Shift+Ctrl+Alt (hide all windows 
	in front of the current output window) feature.

	When several windows are open, the current 
	output window may sometimes become hidden 
	behind some of the other windows.  You can 
	press Shift+Ctrl+Alt to momentarily hide all 
	windows that are in front of the current 
	output window.  Use OUTSHOW to disable this 
	feature.

OVERLAY
    [VFP] OVERLAY special item is no longer needed.
    
	Specifies where FoxPro should place its .OVL 
	(overlay) file.  This applies to Standard 
	FoxPro only; the Extended version does not use 
	overlay files.  At startup, the .OVL file in 
	the same directory as the FOXPRO.EXE file is used.  
	Specifying OVERLAY causes FoxPro to look in the 
	new location for the files.

	If the files are not present in this directory, 
	the originals are copied to the new location.  
	If the files exist in the new directory but are 
	not dated identically to the originals, FoxPro 
	asks for permission to overwrite the files.  If 
	you give permission, FoxPro overwrites the files 
	with the new copies; otherwise, it uses the originals.

	If you include the optional OVERWRITE key word, 
	FoxPro automatically overwrites the existing 
	files without prompting for permission. See the 
	discussion of these commands at the end of this 
	section.

PROGWORK
    [VFP] default is Windows temporary file directory.
    
	  Note: SYS(2023) Returns the path on which
		Visual FoxPro stores its temporary 
		files. 
    
	Specifies where the program cache file will 
	be placed.  Users may wish to put this file 
	in a RAM disk or on a local workstation drive.  
	FoxPro tries to keep the size of this file less 
	than 256 K, but it can grow larger if necessary.  
	
	It may be especially useful to specify PROGWORK 
	when using FoxPro in a multi-user environment.  
	See the discussion of this and related commands 
	at the end of this section.  

REPORT
	Specifies the extension for FoxPro report 
	definition files.  The default extension is .FRX.

RESOURCE
    [VFP] may also specify 'OFF'
    
	  RESOURCE = OFF
	  
	  Bypasses the use of resource file, useful
	  in multi-user distributed applications.

	Specifies where FoxPro is to find the FOXUSER 
	resource file.  <pathname> may be a directory 
	or a fully-qualified pathname.  If <pathname> 
	is a directory, then a file named FOXUSER.DBF 
	is searched for.  Otherwise, a file with the 
	specified name is searched for.  If the file 
	does not exist it is created.  

SORTWORK
    [VFP] default is Windows temporary file directory.
    
	  Note: SYS(2023) Returns the path on which
		Visual FoxPro stores its temporary 
		files. 
    
	Specifies where commands such as SORT and INDEX 
	will place their temporary work files.  SORT and 
	INDEX can require work space up to twice the size 
	of the file being sorted or indexed, so be sure 
	there is enough room in this directory.  This 
	parameter can be useful when you are operating 
	FoxPro in a multi-user environment.  SORTWORK 
	and related commands are discussed at the end of 
	this section.

TEDIT 
	[VFP]  /N optional clause to specify a
	       Windows text editor.
	       
	Specifies the external text editor used when you 
	edit program files with MODIFY COMMAND.

	You can include the optional clause /<expN> 
	with TEDIT to specify the amount of memory FoxPro 
	should make available for an external text editor.  
	<expN> specifies the amount of memory in kilobytes 
	(K) that is made available. To make as much memory 
	available to the text editor as possible, 
	specify a value of 0 (zero):

    TEDIT = /0 <editor>

TIME
    [VFP] TIME special item is no longer needed.

	Establishes the amount of time that FoxPro waits 
	for the print device to accept a character.  If 
	the printer is not ready, this value dictates the 
	number of retries that FoxPro will make to the 
	print device.  If the retry count is exhausted, 
	FoxPro issues the error 
	
	"Printer not ready. Retry? (Y/N)"  
	
	The value of TIME may range from 1 to 1,000,000 
	retries.  The default is 6,000.

TITLE
    [VFP] Specifies the title that appears in the caption
	  of the main Visual Foxpro window.  Default
	  is "MicroSoft Visual Foxpro".
	  
	  This is similar to _screen.Caption="caption"
	  from the Command window.
		    
    TITLE <caption> was not in the original MSDOS
    documentation.
    
TMPFILES
    [VFP] default is Windows temporary file directory.
    
	  Note: SYS(2023) Returns the path on which
		Visual FoxPro stores its temporary 
		files. 
    
	Sets the drive to which the EDITWORK, SORTWORK 
	and PROGWORK files will be stored if they have 
	not been specified otherwise with any of the 
	other options.   This can be useful for optimizing 
	performance in a multi-user environment.  

	The EDITWORK, OVERLAY, PROGWORK, SORTWORK and 
	TMPFILES special configuration items let you specify 
	where temporary work files and frequently accessed 
	FoxPro files will be placed.  Careful placement of 
	these files can improve FoxPro's performance, 
	particularly on a network.

	If possible these files should be placed on the 
	fastest drive available.  On networks the fastest 
	drive is usually a workstation's local drive.  Be 
	sure to provide ample disk space for the temporary 
	work files as some can grow quite large.

	Further performance information can be found in 
	the chapters Optimizing Your System in the 
	Installation and Configuration manual and 
	Optimizing Your Application in the FoxPro 
	Developer's Guide.
