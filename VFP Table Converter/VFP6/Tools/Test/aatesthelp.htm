<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The Automated Test Harness tool has been built on Microsoft Active 
Accessibility (MSAA) technology. It can be used with all Visual Foxpro 
applications.</P>
<P>Following are the list of files used with the Automated Test Harness:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<UL><L1>
  <P>AARECORD.SCX/SCT: The main form including the recording/playback logic.</P><L1>
  <P>AAUTILS.VCX/VCT: The class library which has the class cstglobal. This is 
  shared by different forms.</P><L1>
  <P>AASCRIPTS.DBF/FPT: The event logging table.</P><L1>
  <P>AATESTLOG.DBF/FPT The event logging table.</P>

<P>To run the tool, do the following:</P>
<OL></FONT>
  <LI>The files are installed in the folder \Tools\Test\ folder under the VFP home directory. Run the main form AARECORD.SCX. Launch 
  a new Visual FoxPro instance from the Fox button provided. To record the 
  script, click Record button in the toolbar or select from Menu. You see a list of available applications. 
  <LI>Select a Visual FoxPro application. You see a prompt to enter the "Test 
  name" to identify the test. 
  <LI>Now, its ready to record the events and you can enter the events you wish to record. To start with, 
  enter the commands from command window or use the menu directly. Make sure you click the parent menu 
  to select the submenu (such as Tools/Wizard). You cannot just move your mouse 
  to select the sub menu, it should be clicked. 
  <LI>When finished, click Stop. You can also pause and resume recording. 
  <P>To view the recorded events log which has been selected or currently recorded, click View Log. 
  <P>To stop the recording process, click Cancel. 
  <P>To play back the scripts, select the script you want to run and click Play button. If the program detects an error, you 
  see a prompt to wait.

<P>&nbsp;<A name=RECORDER></A></P></FONT>
<H3>Recorder</H3>
<P>The recorder uses Visual FoxPro event logging to log all events, such as 
mouse and keyboard.</P>
<P><A name=PLAYBACK></A></P>
<H3>Playback<FONT size=2> </H3></FONT>
<P>The playback logic uses Active Accessibility in part to find the objects. The 
program emulates output events using windows APIs and Visual FoxPro 
functions. </P><FONT size=4>
<P><A name=OUTSTANDING_ISSUES></A></P></FONT>
<H3>Outstanding Issues</H3>
<P>The following outstanding issues exist for the Automated Test Harness:</P>
<LI>Because Visual FoxPro does not support keyboard commands such as shift+tab 
or ctrl+tab, you cannot use them with this program. 
<LI>If a you set the scrollbars property in a form, it may not play correctly 
because the script does not capture the caption. 
<LI>Clicking the title bar on dialog boxes such as MESSAGEBOX() may not work 
because the positions are not consistent.

<P><A name=KNOWN_ISSUES></A></P></FONT>
<H3>Known Issues</H3>
<P>The following known issues exist for the Automated Test Harness:</P>
<LI>Clicking the edges of menus or objects does not work consistently. 
<LI>If the object position has been changed, the playback does not re-calculate 
the new position. 
<LI>The VFP window should be kept similar (although it may be maximized) during 
record and playback since the events with respect to main desktop does not 
always work. 
<LI>You cannot use the mouse to drag and drop a window or an object.<FONT
